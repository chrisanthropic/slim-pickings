## Testing Chord_Ceph_Tag_B with the project samples. Pag # 12.

For the master mix:

1. 0.5 µl of each primer (F and R) = 8.5 µl each
2. 5 µl of Kapa HotStart = Total of 85 µl
3. 5 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 25 ul total reaction
4. 1 µl of DNA template (30ng/ml); depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample
5. 12 µl total reaction
6. 11 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube
7. I tested 14 samples and 2 negative 
8. 52 C

### Gel 1: 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 1.5 hours at 110V

### all GSO samples amplified well and IPT samples doesn't work in this PCR work
