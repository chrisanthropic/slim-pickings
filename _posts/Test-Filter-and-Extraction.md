# Test Filtering Seawater and Extracting DNA

## Filtering
- Two 1L water samples were taken from the GSO beach area and filtered the same day (about 1 hour after sampling)
- Samples were filtered with the sample funnel because they were from the same location but with separate filters
- Before filtering, the benchtop was wipped down with 10% bleach, DI water, then 70% ethanol
- The two water samples has some sand and particulates settled to the bottom
    * One whirl pak was kept settled, and when poring water into the funnel, the debris at the bottom was not poured out. This was called the "clean" sample
    * One whirl pak was shook before pouring into the funnel so that it simulated a more turbid sample and was called the "dirty" sample
- Both dirty and clean samples did not clog the filter and all of 1L was vacuum filtered
- Filters were removed from the funneling apparatus with forceps. Forceps were cleaned with 10% bleach, DI water, and 70% EtOH before and between uses. Filters were folded multiple times then stuffed in 1.5mL tubes and frozen at -20 degrees.

## DNA Extraction
DNA was extracted from both samples with the Qiagen DNeasy Kit and modifications from Renshaw et. al
- Before extraction, the benchtop was wiped down with 10% bleach, DI water, then 70% ethanol
- Added to each tube with the frozen filters:
    * 567µl buffer ATL
    * 63µl Proteinase K
- Samples were digested at 65 degrees C for 1 hour on the thermomixer and shaking at 600rpm
- After incubation, the filters were taken out of the 1.5mL tubes to get at the liquid with cleaned forceps (same as above). Excess liquid was squeezed out as best as possible with the forceps into new 1.5mL tubes
- Liquid from the original 1.5mL tube and the squeezed liquid was transferred to new 5mL tubes
- Added to each 5mL tube and then vortexed
    * 630µl buffer AL
    * 630µl 100% EtOH
- The sample had to run through the spin column 3 times.
    * Added 600µl sample to the spin column then centrifuged at 8000rpm for 1 minute
    * Transfer column to new collection tube
    * **Repeat above steps twice more to run all sample though the column**
- Added 500µl buffer AW1 to the columns then centrifuged at 8000rpm for 1 minute
- Transferred columns to new collection tubes, added 500µl buffer AW2 and centrifuged at 14000rpm for 3 minutes
- Transferred columns to final 1.5mL tubes
    * Added 50µl warmed (56 degrees C) buffer AE directly to the filter
    * Incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes
    * Centrifuged at 8000rpm for 1 minute
    * **in the same 1.5mL tube** repeated above steps with 30µl warmed buffer AE
- Extracted DNA was frozen at -20 and a gel was run the next day
- A 1.5% agarose gel was made with GelRed and run for 45 minutes
