# Testing L14912_CYB. Pag # 36.

For the master mix:

1. 1 µl of each primer (F and R)
2. 12.5 µl of Biomix
3. 9 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 25 ul total reaction
4. 1.5 DNA template, the first 8 samples with 15ug/ul
5. I added 1.5 ul of BSA
6. 25 µl total reaction
7. I tested 7 samples and 1 negatives
